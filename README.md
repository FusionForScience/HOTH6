## Idea and Goals

We wanted to create delve into the world of ML while also creating something enjoyable for the end user. 

This is a game where the player creates levels for the character to train on and then tests them on a "Campaign" mode.

Built using Python3 and PyGame


## Story

Opportunity is stranded on Mars! Please come home Opportunity...

But we can't contact her and guide her to the end. So Opportunity must train herself...

Design levels to help her find her way back to an outpost! Remember you cannot directly control her, but only design
training courses to help her further her progress...
